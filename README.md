2D Game Using Java

A 2D Game Developed by using Java This Game is developed by using Java AWT and Swing Commands

JAVA AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) is an API to develop GUI or window-based applications in Java. Java AWT Components are platform-dependent i.e. components are displayed according to the view of Operating System. AWT is heavyweight i.e. its components are using the resources of the OS.

JAVA Swing is a part of Java Foundation classes (JFC) that is used to create window-based applications. It is built on the top of AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) API and entirely written in Java. Unlike AWT, Java Swing provides platform-independent and lightweight components.
